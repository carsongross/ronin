## Why Tosa?

Sometimes you just want a quick and dirty data persistence solution that's
easy to use. You don't want to deal with XML configuration files, or code
generation, but you don't want to have to memorize your database schema,
either. Tosa provides a low-effort, type-safe object-relational mapping
layer on top of a SQL database (theoretically, any database that JDBC
supports). Just set up your database schema following a few simple guidelines,
and you automatically have object-oriented access to your data with compile-
time error checking.

## Getting started

Tosa ships as a dependency in the default Ronin application setup, so you can use it right out of the box.

Let's look at the [database schema guidelines](Schema-Guidelines.html).
