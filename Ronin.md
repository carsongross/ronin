## Why Ronin?

Imagine you're developing a web application with a typical web framework.
You've noticed a bug on some page of your app - how do you fix it? Maybe
you'll look for some distinctive text on the page, then search for that text
in your project using your favorite IDE. Say the text turns up a template
which was used to generate the page. Now you have to track down the data that
was used to render the template, which means you need to find the code that
retrieved the data, and maybe an XML configuration file which specifies how
that data was mapped to an identifier used in the template. If you're not
intimately familiar with the inner workings of the app, and of the framework
you're using, you've got a lot of searching to do.

With Ronin, everything is out in the open - there's no reflective magic or
arcane XML files. The URL in your browser tells you which method on which
class was called to generate the current page. That method contains a call to
render the template for the page, and an explicit set of parameters providing
the data for the template. If you're using Eclipse, you can navigate between
all these different pieces with a single click. And best of all, should you
make a mistake - misspell a file name, or leave out a parameter - there will
be a compilation error, so you'll know right away instead of having to
exhaustively walk through your app (or maintain 100% unit test coverage).

## Getting started

Here's what you need to get started with Ronin:

  * [Java][3] 6 or later.

  * [Aardvark][5], a build system for Gosu.  Version 0.4 or greater is required

Once you've got all that, you're ready to [write your first Ronin app](Your-First-Ronin-App.html).
